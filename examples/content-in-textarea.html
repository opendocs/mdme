# Atomic Theory

**Atomic theory** is a scientific theory of the nature of matter, which
states that matter is composed of discrete units called *atoms*. It
began as a philosophical concept in ancient Greece and entered the
scientific mainstream in the early 19th century when discoveries in the
field of chemistry showed that matter did indeed behave as if it were
made up of atoms.


## John Dalton

Dalton believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbed different
gases in different proportions - for example, he found that water
absorbed carbon dioxide far better than it absorbed nitrogen.
